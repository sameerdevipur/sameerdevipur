    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I see myself as someone who is constantly curious and
      mildly allergic to simple answers. Professionally, I am a PhD student
      in Physics working on Battery Safety and Energy Systems, which mostly
      means poking complex systems until they reveal how they behave.
    </p>

    <p>
      My academic background is in Chemical Engineering, so I tend to think
      in terms of processes, materials, and why things fail in interesting
      ways. In my free time, I track game progress, write notes that may or
      may not turn into proper ideas, take photos of things that catch my
      eye, and collect fun facts that serve no immediate purpose but feel
      important anyway.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is less a formal biography and more an honest snapshot of
      how I think, work, and occasionally overthink.

      If you’re looking for a more polished version of my academic history,
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sameer-v-devipur/"

      has that covered.
