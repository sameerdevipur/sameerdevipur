    <h1>Blog</h1>

    <p>
      I used to write short articles and fun stories on
      <a href="https://thedopplerdude.blogspot.com"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        thedopplerdude.blogspot.com
      </a>,
      which started as a team writing experiment with a couple of friends
      and slowly turned into a place for ideas that did not quite fit
      anywhere else.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the moment, this page is in a quiet phase, thanks to me going
      through a writer’s block. The intention, however, is still very
      much alive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Someday this space will fill up again with unfiltered thoughts,
      half-formed ideas, and observations that feel worth writing down,
      even if they are not fully polished.
