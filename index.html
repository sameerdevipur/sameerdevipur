    <h1>Hi, I’m Sameer.</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to my website. This is a small collection of things that I find worth
      sharing, ranging from my work in Science and Energy Research to notes,
      experiments, games, and ideas that refuse to stay in my head. You will
      find snapshots of what I am working on, informal writing, progress logs,
      a few fun facts, and a few snaps that shows the world I see through my
      eyes. Nothing here is meant to be definitive. It is a record of learning,
      tinkering, and occasionally getting things right for the wrong reasons.
