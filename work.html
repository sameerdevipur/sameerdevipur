    <h1>My Work</h1>

    <p>
      My work sits at the uncomfortable but fascinating edge where energy
      storage stops behaving politely. I am a PhD student in Physics
      working on Thermal Runaway in Lithium-ion batteries, a failure
      process in which a battery transitions from a controlled
      electrochemical device into a rapidly evolving chemical reactor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once initiated, thermal runaway is fast, violent, and unforgiving.
      Temperature rises within seconds, gases are released, materials
      decompose, and the system quickly outruns any simple safety
      mechanism. Understanding this process in detail is no longer
      optional. It is a prerequisite for <em>safe electrification</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      At a high level, thermal runaway begins when heat generation inside
      a cell exceeds its ability to dissipate that heat. The trigger can
      be mechanical abuse, electrical abuse, or external heating.
      Internally, it unfolds as a cascade. The solid electrolyte
      interphase begins to break down and electrolytes decompose. Electrodes
      react with each other in ways they were never designed to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each step releases additional heat, accelerating the next. The
      system feeds on itself. By the time flames or venting are visible,
      the most important chemistry has already occurred.
    </p>

    <p>
      Current research has mapped many pieces of this puzzle, but not the
      full picture. We understand individual reaction pathways reasonably
      well in isolation. We have solid models for heat generation under
      normal operation, and we know typical onset temperatures for
      specific decomposition mechanisms.
    </p>

    <p>
      What remains difficult is connecting these pieces into a single,
      time-resolved description of a real thermal runaway event. Most
      measurements are indirect. Most diagnostics integrate over time.
      Many experiments stop just before things become truly interesting,
      for understandable safety reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>This is where my work comes in.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      I use Laser-based Diagnostics to observe thermal runaway as it
      unfolds, in real time, without touching the system. Lasers allow
      remote, selective, and extremely fast interrogation of matter.
      Instead of measuring temperature at a single point or collecting
      post-mortem debris, I probe which gas species are released, how
      their concentrations evolve, and how reaction pathways shift as
      the event progresses.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the core of this approach is <em>Spectroscopy</em>. Molecules interact
      with light in very specific ways. Each molecule absorbs or emits
      light at characteristic wavelengths that act as fingerprints. By
      tuning a laser to the appropriate wavelength and measuring how the
      light changes as it passes through a gas plume, it becomes possible
      to identify which species are present and in what quantities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Performed fast enough, this yields time-resolved chemistry, not
      just an outcome.
    </p>

        laser-based spectroscopic diagnostics.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Different spectroscopic techniques emphasize different aspects of
      the problem. Absorption spectroscopy tracks toxic and flammable
      gases as they form and disappear. Emission spectroscopy reveals
      excited species and high-temperature reaction zones. Laser-induced
      breakdown spectroscopy probes elemental composition when materials
      violently fragment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together, these tools allow reconstruction of the chemical
      narrative of thermal runaway, frame by frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      The challenge is not only experimental. Thermal runaway is not a
      clean experiment with steady boundary conditions. It is a
      transient, multi-physics event involving heat transfer, fluid
      dynamics, chemical kinetics, and materials failure all at once.
    </p>

    <p>
      A significant part of my work involves extracting meaning from
      this complexity and translating it into models that are both
      physically grounded and practically useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The end goal is not merely to describe thermal runaway, but to
      model it as a complete process. From the first instability to the
      final venting products. From internal reactions to external
      consequences.
    </p>

    <p>
      A reliable model enables prediction. Prediction enables
      prevention. And prevention is where battery safety improves,
      whether through better materials, smarter pack design, early
      detection systems, or informed regulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, I am trying to turn a catastrophic event into a
      measurable, understandable, and ultimately manageable phenomenon.
      Batteries will continue to power more of the world. My job is to
      help ensure they fail less often, and when they do fail, that we
      understand exactly why.
