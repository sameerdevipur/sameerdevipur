    <h1>My work</h1>

    <p>
  My work sits at the uncomfortable but fascinating edge where
  <strong>Energy Storage</strong> stops behaving politely. I am a
  <strong>PhD student in Physics</strong> working on
  <strong>Thermal Runaway</strong> in <strong>Lithium-Ion Batteries</strong>,
  a failure process in which a battery transitions from a controlled
  <strong>Electrochemical Device</strong> into a rapidly evolving
  <strong>Chemical Reactor</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Once initiated, <strong>Thermal Runaway</strong> is fast, violent, and
  unforgiving. <strong>Temperature</strong> rises within seconds,
  <strong>Gases</strong> are released, <strong>Materials</strong>
  decompose, and the system quickly outruns any simple
  <strong>Safety Mechanism</strong>. Understanding this process in detail
  is no longer optional. It is a prerequisite for safe
  <strong>Electrification</strong>.
</p>

    <p>
  At a high level, <strong>Thermal Runaway</strong> begins when
  <strong>Heat Generation</strong> inside a cell exceeds its ability to
  <strong>Dissipate Heat</strong>. The trigger can be
  <strong>Mechanical Abuse</strong>, <strong>Electrical Abuse</strong>,
  or <strong>External Heating</strong>. Internally, it unfolds as a
  cascade. The <strong>Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI)</strong>
  begins to break down. <strong>Electrolytes</strong> decompose.
  <strong>Electrodes</strong> react with each other in ways they were
  never designed to.
</p>

<p>
  Each step releases additional heat, accelerating the next. The system
  feeds on itself. By the time flames or venting are visible, the most
  important <strong>Chemistry</strong> has already occurred.
</p>

<p>
  Current research has mapped many pieces of this puzzle, but not the
  full picture. We understand individual
  <strong>Reaction Pathways</strong> reasonably well in isolation. We
  have solid models for <strong>Heat Generation</strong> under normal
  operation. We know typical <strong>Onset Temperatures</strong> for
  specific <strong>Decomposition Mechanisms</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  What remains difficult is connecting these pieces into a single,
  <strong>Time-Resolved</strong> description of a real
  <strong>Thermal Runaway</strong> event. Most measurements are indirect.
  Most diagnostics integrate over time. Many experiments stop just
  before things become truly interesting, for understandable
  <strong>Safety</strong> reasons.
</p>

<p>
  <em>This is where my work comes in.</em>
</p>

<p>
  I use <strong>Laser-Based Diagnostics</strong> to observe
  <strong>Thermal Runaway</strong> as it unfolds, in real time, without
  touching the system. Lasers allow <strong>Remote</strong>,
  <strong>Selective</strong>, and extremely <strong>Fast</strong>
  interrogation of matter. Instead of measuring
  <strong>Temperature</strong> at a single point or collecting
  post-mortem debris, I probe which <strong>Gas Species</strong> are
  released, how their <strong>Concentrations</strong> evolve, and how
  <strong>Reaction Pathways</strong> shift as the event progresses.
</p>

<p>
  At the core of this approach is <strong>Spectroscopy</strong>. In
  simple terms, molecules interact with light in very specific ways.
  Each molecule absorbs or emits light at characteristic
  <strong>Wavelengths</strong> that act as
  <strong>Spectral Fingerprints</strong>. By tuning a laser to the
  appropriate Wavelength and measuring how the light changes as it
  passes through a <strong>Gas Plume</strong>, it becomes possible to
  identify which species are present and in what quantities.
</p>
    
<p>
  Performed fast enough, this yields
  <strong>Time-Resolved Chemistry</strong>, not just an outcome.
</p>

        laser-based spectroscopic diagnostics.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

 <p>
  Different <strong>Spectroscopic Techniques</strong> emphasize
  different aspects of the problem.
  <strong>Absorption Spectroscopy</strong> tracks toxic and flammable
  Gases as they form and disappear.
  <strong>Emission Spectroscopy</strong> reveals excited species and
  high-Temperature reaction zones.
  <strong>Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS)</strong> probes
  <strong>Elemental Composition</strong> when materials violently
  fragment.
</p>

<p>
  Together, these tools allow reconstruction of the Chemical narrative
  of <strong>Thermal Runaway</strong>, frame by frame.
</p>

<p>
  The challenge is not only experimental.
  <strong>Thermal Runaway</strong> is not a clean experiment with steady
  <strong>Boundary Conditions</strong>. It is a transient,
  <strong>Multi-Physics</strong> event involving
  <strong>Heat Transfer</strong>, <strong>Fluid Dynamics</strong>,
  <strong>Chemical Kinetics</strong>, and
  <strong>Materials Failure</strong> all at once.
</p>

<p>
  A significant part of my work involves extracting meaning from this
  complexity and translating it into models that are both
  <strong>Physically Grounded</strong> and
  <strong>Practically Useful</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  The end goal is not merely to describe
  <strong>Thermal Runaway</strong>, but to model it as a complete
  process. From the first <strong>Instability</strong> to the final
  <strong>Venting Products</strong>. From internal reactions to external
  consequences.
</p>

<p>
  A reliable model enables <strong>Prediction</strong>. Prediction
  enables <strong>Prevention</strong>. And Prevention is where
  <strong>Battery Safety</strong> improves, whether through better
  Materials, smarter <strong>Pack Design</strong>,
  <strong>Early Detection Systems</strong>, or informed
  <strong>Regulation</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  In short, I am trying to turn a catastrophic event into a measurable,
  understandable, and ultimately manageable phenomenon. Batteries will
  continue to power more of the world. My job is to help ensure they fail
  less often, and when they do fail, that we understand exactly why.
