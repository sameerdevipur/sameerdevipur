    <h1>My Work</h1>

    <p>
      My work sits at the uncomfortable but fascinating edge where energy
      storage stops behaving politely. I am a PhD student in Physics working
      on thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries, a failure process in which
      a battery transitions from a controlled electrochemical device into a
      rapidly evolving chemical reactor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once initiated, thermal runaway is fast, violent, and unforgiving.
      Temperature rises within seconds, gases are released, materials
      decompose, and the system quickly outruns any simple safety mechanism.
      Understanding this process in detail is no longer optional. It is a
      prerequisite for <em>safe electrification</em>.

    <p>
      At a high level, thermal runaway begins when heat generation inside
      a cell exceeds its ability to dissipate that heat. The trigger can be
      mechanical abuse, electrical abuse, or external heating. Internally,
      it unfolds as a cascade.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each step releases additional heat, accelerating the next. The system
      feeds on itself. By the time flames or venting are visible, the most
      important chemistry has already occurred.
    </p>

    <p>
      Current research has mapped many pieces of this puzzle, but not the
      full picture. Individual reaction pathways are well understood in
      isolation. Models for heat generation under normal operation are solid.
      Onset temperatures for specific decomposition mechanisms are known.
    </p>

    <p>
      What remains difficult is connecting these pieces into a single,
      time-resolved description of a real thermal runaway event. Most
      measurements are indirect. Most diagnostics integrate over time. Many
      experiments stop just before things become truly interesting.
    </p>

    <p><em>This is where my work comes in.</em></p>

    <p>
      I use laser-based diagnostics to observe thermal runaway as it unfolds,
      in real time, without physical contact. Lasers allow remote, selective,
      and extremely fast interrogation of matter.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the core of this approach is <em>spectroscopy</em>. Molecules interact
      with light in specific ways. Each molecule absorbs or emits light at
      characteristic wavelengths that act as fingerprints.
    </p>

    <p>
      Performed fast enough, this yields time-resolved chemistry, not merely
      an outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      Different spectroscopic techniques emphasize different aspects of the
      problem. Absorption spectroscopy tracks toxic and flammable gases as
      they form and disappear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together, these tools allow reconstruction of the chemical narrative
      of thermal runaway, frame by frame.
    </p>

    <p>
      The challenge is not only experimental. Thermal runaway is a transient,
      multi-physics event involving heat transfer, fluid dynamics, chemical
      kinetics, and materials failure simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
      A significant part of my work involves extracting meaning from this
      complexity and translating it into models that are both physically
      grounded and practically useful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The end goal is not merely to describe thermal runaway, but to model it
      as a complete process.
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, I am trying to turn a catastrophic event into a measurable,
      understandable, and ultimately manageable phenomenon.
