    <h1>My work</h1>

    <p>
      My work sits at the uncomfortable but fascinating edge where energy
      storage stops behaving politely. I am a PhD student in physics working
      on thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries, a failure process where a
      battery transitions from a controlled electrochemical device into a
      rapidly evolving chemical reactor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once initiated, thermal runaway is fast, violent, and unforgiving.
      Temperatures rise within seconds, gases are released, materials
      decompose, and the system quickly outruns any simple safety mechanism.
      Understanding this process in detail is not optional anymore. It is a
      prerequisite for safe electrification.
    </p>

    <p>
      At a high level, thermal runaway begins when heat generation inside a
      cell exceeds its ability to dissipate that heat. The trigger can be
      mechanical abuse, electrical abuse, or external heating. Internally,
      it is a cascade. The solid electrolyte interphase starts to break down.
      Electrolytes decompose. Electrodes react with each other in ways they
      were never designed to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Current research has mapped many pieces of this puzzle, but not the
      full picture. We understand individual reactions reasonably well in
      isolation. What remains difficult is connecting these pieces into a
      single, time-resolved description of a real thermal runaway event.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is where my work comes in.
    </p>

    <p>
      I use laser-based diagnostics to observe thermal runaway as it unfolds,
      in real time, without touching the system. Lasers allow remote,
      selective, and extremely fast interrogation of reacting systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the core of this approach is spectroscopy. Molecules interact with
      light in specific ways. Each species absorbs or emits light at
      characteristic wavelengths that act as fingerprints. Tracking these
      interactions enables time-resolved chemistry rather than post-mortem
      interpretation.
    </p>

        Schematic representation of absorption and emission processes used
        in spectroscopic diagnostics.

    </figure>

    <p>
      Different spectroscopic techniques emphasize different parts of the
      problem. Absorption spectroscopy tracks toxic and flammable gases.
      Emission spectroscopy reveals excited species and high-temperature
      reaction zones. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy probes elemental
      composition when materials violently fragment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The challenge is not only experimental. Thermal runaway is a transient,
      multi-physics event involving heat transfer, fluid dynamics, chemical
      kinetics, and materials failure all at once. Extracting meaning from
      this complexity is a central part of my work.
    </p>

    <p>
      The end goal is not just to describe thermal runaway, but to model it as
      a complete process. Prediction enables prevention. Prevention is where
      battery safety improves.
    </p>

    <p>
      In short, I am trying to turn a catastrophic event into a measurable,
      understandable, and ultimately manageable phenomenon.
