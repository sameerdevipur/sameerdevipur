    <h1>Side quests</h1>

    <p>
      This page is a loose collection of games I have played, movies and
      shows that stuck with me, and a growing pile of miscellaneous trivia
      that did not fit anywhere else.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing here is ranked or curated too carefully. It is simply a
      snapshot of what I enjoy, what I revisit, and the small distractions
      that quietly shape how I think and unwind.

            Progress is not tied to power or inventory. It is tied to
            understanding. Information itself becomes the unlock mechanism.
