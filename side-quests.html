  <h1>Side quests</h1>

  <p>
    This page is a loose collection of games I have played, movies and
    shows that stuck with me, and a growing pile of miscellaneous trivia
    that did not fit anywhere else.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nothing here is ranked or curated too carefully. It is simply a
    snapshot of what I enjoy, what I revisit, and the small distractions
    that quietly shape how I think and unwind.

    <h2>Games That Changed My Thinking</h2>

      Not favorites. Systems that altered how I think about structure,
      strategy, and consequence.

        <h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>

          Systems realism · Moral friction · Environmental storytelling · Exploration

        <p>
          I usually never say one game or one movie is a particular favourite,
          but this one is an exception. RDR2 is easily a game I'd recommend every
          gamer to play. Hell, I'd even recommend people to get into gaming just
          to experience this masterpiece.

            The game rewards patience over optimization. It demands immersion.
            You are not rushing toward completion. You are inhabiting a world.

            Don't rush and explore in the first hour. Let the game introduce you slowly.
            Take your absolute sweet time to explore everything later on before finishing the game.

        <h3>Assassin’s Creed Series</h3>
        <p class="game-meta">
          Historical reconstruction · Parkour systems · Iterative design · Amazing trailers
        </p>

        <p>
          Used to be an amazing series with great gameplay and amazing storylines.
          They really took the whole "Free-will vs. Order" concept and rocked it.
          And then they messed it up. In my opinion, Valhalla was the last good
          AC game and everything is shit after that. Hopefully they will pick up and improve.

      <h3>Far Cry Series</h3>
      <p class="game-meta">
        Open-world systems · Emergent chaos · Villain-driven narratives
      </p>

      <p>
        A sandbox built on instability. Fire spreads, animals interfere, enemies
        patrol dynamically. The world is less scripted drama and more volatile
        chemistry.
      </p>

      <div class="expand-content">

      <p>
        At its strongest, the series turns simple mechanics into emergent
        complexity. A single spark becomes wildfire. A stealth attempt becomes
        systemic collapse. The games function as controlled experiments in
        unintended consequence.
      </p>

      <p>
        The antagonists often overshadow the protagonist. The structure places
        ideology in direct conflict with player agency, though later entries
        sometimes repeat the formula without deepening it.

        Design systems that interact unpredictably. Let simple rules collide
