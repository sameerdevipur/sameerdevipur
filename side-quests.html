    <h1>Side quests</h1>

    <p>
      This page is a loose collection of games I have played, movies and
      shows that stuck with me, and a growing pile of miscellaneous trivia
      that did not fit anywhere else.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing here is ranked or curated too carefully. It is simply a
      snapshot of what I enjoy, what I revisit, and the small distractions
      that quietly shape how I think and unwind.

        Not favorites. Systems that altered how I think about structure,
        strategy, and consequence.

          <h3>Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>

            I usually never say one game or one movie is a particular favourite,
            but this one is an exception. RDR2 is easily a game I'd recommend every
            gamer to play. Hell, I'd even recommend people to get into gaming just
            to experience this masterpiece.

            Don't rush and explore in the first hour. Let the game introduce you slowly.
            Take your absolute sweet time to explore everything later on before finishing the game.

    <h3>Assassin’s Creed Series</h3>

      Used to be an amazing series with great gameplay and amazing storylines.
      They really took the whole "Free-will vs. Order" concept and rocked it.
      And then they messed it up. In my opinion, Valhalla was the last good
      AC game and everything is shit after that. Hopefully they will pick up and improve.

      Use environment as curriculum. Let architecture teach the player.
